{"name":"Smuggler","tagline":"Covert messaging for Mac.","body":"# Smuggle\r\nSmuggle is a covert messaging app for Mac which sends your clipboard contents to a\r\ndesignated phone number upon the pressing of a hotkey (`command + shift + up-arrow`).\r\n\r\n## Startup\r\nTo run Smuggler, double click the script app called `Smuggler`. It will prompt you about\r\nspeed-dial and phone numbers. If this is your first time running, note that your speed\r\ndial is blank and you will thus say \"No\" to the first prompt.\r\n\r\nIt will then provide you with an area into which to enter the number. Note that the\r\nplaceholder value hints at the expected format, `+1XXXXXXXXXX`. Upon entering and\r\nsubmitting your number, you will be told as which speed-dial this number has been saved.\r\n\r\nNext, you will verify that it is pairing with the correct number, and the Smuggler app\r\nwill run. The app is a camel residing in your status bar. It is very subtle, with the \r\nonly UI being a `Quit` button and the current phone number with which you are paired.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nWhen you are ready to send a message, select and copy the text (`command + c`) and then\r\nutilize the hotkey for sending, `command + shift + up-arrow`. Before doing this, however,\r\nyou will need to set a few things up.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n### Run Messages\r\nIn order for messages to be sent, the Messages app needs to be running. Luckily, we will\r\nmake the application icon hidden. Hence, we need only hide the application window. This\r\nis easily achieved by placing it in a space separate from your primary work.\r\n\r\n### Hide the Dock Icon\r\nTo hide the dock icon of Messages.app, its bundle will need to be modified. Navigate to\r\n`/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/` and edit the `Info.plist` to include an additional\r\nkey-pair like the following.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\r\n<string>1</string>\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-19294089-15 ","note":"Don't delete this file!
